### Mum's 63rd Birthday Website

- This is a special website to send to my Mum on her birthday to wish her a happy birthday. It contains pictures of happy memories and captions to let her know how loved she is.
- This small project helped me practice foundational concepts learned in my Web Development 2 course, such as making and rendering components, navigation, useState and styling using Tailwind CSS.
